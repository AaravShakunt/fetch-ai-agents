## ðŸ§© Agents Overview

## Our Unique Solution and How we built it
Everything{company} leverages a coordinated team of specialized, modular agents to deliver what others don't: a holistic, synthesized view. While new to the Agentverse platform, we designed a clear workflow emphasizing reusability:

1. ```Everything{company}``` **(The Conductor)**: This main agent receives the company URL and orchestrates the entire process. Crucially, it's designed to be easily integrated into larger financial research or CRM workflows.
2. ```Everything{company} from website``` **(The Profiler)**: Takes the URL, scrapes the site, and uses AI to extract core details. This agent can function independently for any task requiring structured data extraction from a website.
3. ```News Sentiment``` **(The Sentiment Gauge)**: Scans news using the company name and performs sentiment analysis. Built as a standalone service, it can provide sentiment analysis for any entity to other agents.
4. ```Ticker Fetcher``` **(The Stock Detective)**: Finds the correct stock ticker symbol. This component is highly reusable for any financial application needing verified ticker symbols.
5. ```Revenue Summary Agent``` **(The Financial Analyst)**: Fetches financial data via Alpha Vantage and uses Gemini for synthesized summaries. Other agents needing simplified financial reporting can call upon its financial synthesis capabilities.
